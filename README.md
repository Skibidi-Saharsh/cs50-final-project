#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

**All About Drugs (For Teens)** is an educational website created to inform  teenagers about the risks and long-term effects of drug abuse. This project was created as part of Harvard’s CS50 course and uses coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver well-structured, easy-to-understand content for a young audience.

The primary objective of the project is to present information in a teen-friendly way about drugs like marijuana, steroids, and fentanyl. How they are used, what their effects are, and why avoiding them is important. The site avoids medical jargon, and instead focuses on clear, concise explanations with supporting images and simple styling.
