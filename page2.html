  <h1>Marijuana</h1>
  <p>Marijuana (also called weed, dope, or pot) is a mix of dried flowers, stems, seeds, and leaves from the cannabis plant.</p>
  <p>In the past, most people who used marijuana smoked it like a cigarette (a joint) or from different types of pipes. Now it's more common to vape it with a vape pen. Mixing it into foods or drinks (edibles) like brownies, teas, alcohol, or gummies is also very popular.</p>
  <p>Synthetic marijuana (“fake weed”) is made in a lab. It doesn't contain any THC from a marijuana plant, but it is marketed as having the same effects. Fake weed products are largely unregulated. Withdrawal from synthetic marijuana is more serious and lasts longer than withdrawal from THC products.</p>
  <p>Effects of Marijuana are different for every person but smoking marijuana leads to effects very quickly while edibles take longer to have effect. Here are some effects of marijuana:</p>
  <p>Short term effects:</p>
  <ul>Feel more relaxed, hungry, and sleepy</ul>
  <ul>Have a different sense of reality (ex. colors seem brighter)</ul>
  <ul>May feel anxious and distrustful of others.</ul>
  <ul>In rare cases, it can cause short term psychosis with hallucinations(seeing things that aren't there) and paranoia(feel very threatened)</ul>
  <p>Long term effects:</p>
  <ul>Find it harder to remember, multitask, and pay attention</ul>
  <ul>Cough more</ul>
  <ul>Get more lung infections</ul>
  <ul>Get lung scarring</ul>
  <ul>More likely to get depressed, be anxious, or have thoughts of suicide</ul>
  <p>Becoming dependent on Marijuana can develop cannabis use disorder(can't stop using marijuana even if it causes problems) which can make someone:<p>
  <ul>have trouble in social situations</ul>
  <ul>have memory problems</ul>
  <ul>struggle in school or at work</ul>
  </ul>
