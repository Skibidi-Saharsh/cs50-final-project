  <h1>Steroids</h1>
  <p>Steroids are synthetic (manmade) hormones that can boost the body's ability to make muscle and prevent muscle breakdown. Some athletes take steroids in the hopes that they will help them run faster, hit farther, lift heavier weights, jump higher, or have more endurance. </p>
  <p>Steroids are drugs that resemble the chemical structure of the male sex hormone testosterone, which is made naturally by the male body.</p>
  <p>Corticosteroids, such as cortisone, are drugs that doctors prescribe to help control inflammation. They're used to help control conditions like asthma and lupus. They're not the same as the anabolic steroids.</p>
  <p>Anabolic steroids are dangerous for various reasons; they can cause health problems, especially when used in large doses over time, and the problems may not appear until years after a person took steroids. Besides the health risks, people who use steroids without a prescription are breaking the law.</p>
